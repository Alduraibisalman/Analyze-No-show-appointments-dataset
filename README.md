# Analyze No show appointments dataset
# Introdation:
For the final project, I will conduct the data analysis and will create a file to share that documents I findings. I will start by taking a look of my dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I'm most interested in, This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.
# Choose Your Data Set:
I chose the dataset of no show appointments kagglev2 may 2016 and This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
#  Analyze Your Data:
I asked useful questions in my analysis of the appointment data and extracted some useful pointers from it. 
What the most Gender they have an appointement and what is the mean average?
What is the status of attendance the appointment?
Do SMS reminders decrease the number of absences?
# Conclusions
First step of data analysis that I read the data after that I configure the issues with data. In column "Age" I found missing value -1 and that missing values will not influence the results of the analysis I sloved it already. "Scheduled Day" I found the data type not match with the data inside the column so I change it, same issue with the "Appointment Day". I configure a Question to answer it from the analysis. First question is What the most gender they have an appointment and what is the mean average?. Second What is the status of attendance the appointment?. I used the gender and No show column to present them in a chart. In addition, I found the female it's more than 50% of male who's attend the appointment is more than the people that they did not show up.
